# Changelog

No official releases yet. The first public release is in preparation.

## Unreleased

- Multiplayer join and remote admin password limits share tries across each IPv6 /64.
  Filling the bounded address table no longer resets existing limits; new sources wait
  until a slot recovers. Handshake limits use the same source grouping and bounded storage.
- Multiplayer servers reject unknown event kinds and malformed client payloads before
  applying or relaying them. See [accepted events](docs/multiplayer.md#accepted-client-events).
- The GUI includes **Help > About TES3X**, with the version, author, license and links to
  documentation, release notes, the project and issue reporting.
- `bsa`, `convert` and `qcow2` support `--help`. Texture conversion reports sizes without
  writing files; `qcow2` accepts an optional output path for conversion to raw.
- A normal multiplayer server shutdown returns success even when no clients joined.
- First-run guidance points to Settings for file paths and the Target workspace for Xbox
  and xemu setup.
- Settings shows folder defaults and automatic LLVM selection, with **Use default** actions.
  Custom mlox rules are under **Advanced**; normal use downloads rules automatically.
